# cgroup
Control Groups provide a mechanism for aggregating/partitioning sets of tasks, and all their future children,
into hierarchical groups with specialized behaviour.

In short limits how much you can use.
  
Cgroups involve resource metering and limiting:

 1. memory
 2. CPU
 3. block I/O
 4. network
